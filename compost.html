                    <h2>Three Main Benefits</h2>
                    <h4>Eliminates Household Waste by Up to 30%</h4>
                    <p>Recycling redirects waste products from all around the household! Remnants from the cooking-process and from maintaining the yard can be turned into something useful, not something lying in a landfill.</p>

                    <h4>Reduces the Amount of Methane Released
                    </h4>
                    <p>Decomposing organic materials releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas. By keeping it in a relatively well circulated and open area in your compost bin or pile rather than in a landmill, the process of released is slowed and reduced.</p>

                    <h4>Boosts the Health of Your Garden & Plants</h4>
                    <p>Once all the organic material has decomposed, it becomes rich in nutrients and microbes that are hugely beneficial to your plants. It has many benefits including maintaining moisture, reducing plant disease, and keeping out pests.

                    </p>

                    <h2>Three Main Ingredients</h2>

                    <h4>Greens</h4>
                    <p>Organic leftovers from your kitchen can be repurposed to serve in your compost, helping you both reduce food waste and grow your garden.</p>

                    <h4>Browns</h4>
                    <p>Trash? Not so fast! Common items littering your backyard can serve as the perfect growing place for healthy microorganism to make nitrogen for your dirt.</p>

                    <h4>Blues</h4>
                    <p>Water is the last and most essential part of your compost! Providing a moist area can help facillitate the growth of all necessary micro-organisms. Tap or any clean water is safe to use.</p>

                    <h4>Extras</h4>
                    <p>Your composting journey doesn’t have to end there! You can also add other household items to your compost.</p>

                    <h2>Stay Away From</h2>


                    <h4>Tall Compost Piles</h4>
                    <p>Although it may be tempting to keep your compost growing, keeping your compost pile under 12 feet is imperative if you wish to prevent compost fires. Keeping your piles small improves airflow and ensures heat won’t get trapped.</p>

                    <h4>Fish, Meat, or Bones</h4>
                    <p>Unfortuantely, meat products are one of the few things you can’t add to your copost bins. It can provide the perfect hosting place for unwanted animals such as dogs, rats, and raccoons.</p>

                    <h4>Oily and Fat Based Foods</h4>
                    <p>Compost heavily relies on the presence of moisture in the form of water in order to be succesful. Beacause of this, however, oil will not become incorporated with your compost and will instead serve to attract more unwanted animals.</p>
