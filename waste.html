                    <h4>Curbside Pickup</h4>
                    <p>Get involved with recycling from your own front door! Many neighborhoods offer curbside recycling pickup, so all you have to do is collect your recycling in a separate bin and place it outside following the schedule. Check if your neighborhood offers curbside, and get started with a separate bin for recyclables.</p>


                    <h4>Drop-Off Centers</h4>
                    <p>Even if your neighborhood does not offer curbside pickup, there are other easy ways to recycle! Most communities have multiple recycling drop off centers - find a drop off center near you and periodically stop by to drop off your recycling waste. Begin by designating a separate bin for recyclables, and once it fills up take a trip to your local drop off center!</p>
